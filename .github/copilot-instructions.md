# GuitarAcc Project - Nordic nRF Connect SDK

## Project Overview
BLE-based guitar accessory system with two applications:
- **Basestation**: nRF5340 Audio DK (nrf5340_audio_dk_nrf5340_cpuapp)
- **Client**: Thingy:53 (thingy53_nrf5340_cpuapp)

## Development Environment
- Nordic nRF Connect SDK

- nRF Connect for VS Code extension

## Board Targets
- Basestation: `nrf5340_audio_dk_nrf5340_cpuapp`
- Client: `thingy53_nrf5340_cpuapp`

## Important Context Files
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: System architecture, BLE roles, and data flow concepts. Always reference this file when working on BLE functionality or system design.
